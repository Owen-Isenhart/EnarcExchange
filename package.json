  "description": "Enarc Exchange Overview Enarc Exchange is a prediction market specifically for the University of Texas at Dallas. As a student, you can bet (using Temoc Tokens, not real money) on academics, sports, and really anything having to do with UTD! Think that the average grade for linear algebra this semseter will be an A? Bet on it! MVP Auth: Users should be restricted to only those with @utdallas.edu emails Simple authentication with email/password and JWT Upon signup, a new user is issued 500 tokens Market: Markets should be able to be created Markets should have betting and pricing functionality (LMSR) Markets should be able to be resolved and distribute tokens Real Time Data: Markets should update with live data using websockets Markets should have live chat feed Profiles: Should have CRUD functionality for accessing user specific data (P/L, active bets, closed bets, etc.) Stretch Goals Integration with UTD Data: For markets where it applies, say for instance there's a market on what the dining hall will serve on a given day, we pull data from here to determine the resolution instead of doing it manually Automatic AI Generated Markets: Integrate with Gemini or another LLM, give it context for UTD and prompt it for what markets make sense. Make it automatically run if the number of markets drops below a certain threshold, so we never have zero available markets to bet on. Leaderboard: Show the most successful traders based on profits Containerization: Ideally we get to containerize this using Docker, but we may just not have time to get to it Tech Stack API: Node/Express DB: PostgreSQL Websockets: Socket.io Auth: JWT AI Features: Gemini Flash Containerization: Docker Documentation: Swagger Deployment: AWS (EC2 and RDS) Testing: Jest (unit tests) Postman (API testing) Frontend: Next.js (This is a backend project, but it would be nice to actually visualize what yall are building. If anyone wants the experience they can do this, otherwise I'll throw something together towards the end.) Resources Intro to Rest APIs (just first 2 mins and 30 seconds) JWT Intro Node/Express/Typescript part 1 Node/Express/Typescript part 2 Node/Express/Typescript part 3 Chat/Sockets Example Deploying to EC2 Intro to Database Design AWS RDS Swagger Documentation Generator (I haven't tried this, so if it doesn't work we'll just do it manually. This is a good use case for AI) Timeline this is subject to change",
